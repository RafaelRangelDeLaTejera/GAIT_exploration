### Music Generation: 
Immerse yourself in the world of AI-created music. Our backend Node.js server integrates with Facebook's MusicGen model to generate mesmerizing audio compositions in real-time, 
allowing you to download and listen to .mp3 files directly through our built-in music player.

## How it Works:

Behind the scenes, our applicaiton is broke down into two main parts. The frontend React.js project and the backend Node.js and associated Python executable file. Our frontend enables
our Text Generation and Image Generation features by communicating directly with OpenAI via embedded API calls. We have developed dynamic custom React components 
including custom chat widgets generate prompts, allow full chats with ChatGPT, and embedded and an mp3 player, which integrate seamlessy with our simple but stunning UI.

Our application utilizes a robust backend powered by Node.js. This backend runs a Python executable script to interact seamlessly with Facebook's MusicGen-Small, enabling on-the-fly music
composition and delivery.The result is a harmonious blend of technology and artistry, which are stored locally on your device to use as you see fit!

Whether you're a curious newcomer or a seasoned enthusiast, the Generative AI Sandbox is your gateway to the endless possibilities of AI creativity. Get started today and explore the magic of AI-driven generative art and music.
